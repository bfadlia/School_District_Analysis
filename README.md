# School_District_Analysis_Challenge
PyCitySchools Project

## Objective
1. Learn about using Jupyter Notebook to open files from local directories.
2. Read external CSV file into a DataFrame.
3. Format, search, groupby, replace columns, merge, filter and slice dataframes.



## Purpose
PyCity school district suspected Thomas High School's 9th grade Reading and Math scores have been falsified to make the school results look better. The district board asked in this project for us to locate and remove this specific data then perform re-apply the analysis of the district-wide data to compare the results beore and after the removal of the wrong data. 


## Results

### How is the district summary affected?
Original Analysis:
	

There was very little impact by school type by changing the 9th grade scores. 

## Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

1. The overall passing rate for Thomas High School changed dramatically from 91% to 65%. 

2. Thomas High School's ranking dropped from 2nd to 8th in the district of 15 campuses. 

3. Data at the grade level will now show as "NaN" in reports for the 9th grade students at Thomas High School  

4. In addition to the overall passing rate, the campus math and reading averages and passing percentages all saw shifts.  

The major changes will be seen at the lower views of the disaggregated data with minor impact to the larger data views.
